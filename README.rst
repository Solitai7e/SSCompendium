Systemspace Compendium
======================

This is a relatively more up-to-date and complete version of the Compendium created from a newer revision of it found on `1126's now-defunct site`_ and `the original repository on GitHub`_.

With a few exceptions, content exclusive to either copies is included here. I have not thoroughly checked myself that there is no redundant/outdated information however.
